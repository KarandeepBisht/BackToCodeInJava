# BackToCodeInJava 🚀

This repository is not just about Java code.  
It’s about **starting again**.

There was a time when I was coding regularly, learning new things, and moving forward as a developer.  
Then life happened — responsibilities, pressure, self-doubt, breaks, distractions.  
Slowly, consistency was lost… and so was confidence.

One day I realized something simple but powerful:

> I never quit Java. I just stopped showing up.

**BackToCodeInJava** is my decision to show up again.

## 🌱 The Journey

This repo documents my journey of:
- Restarting Java from fundamentals
- Rebuilding problem-solving skills
- Fixing gaps I ignored earlier
- Writing code regularly, even on bad days
- Becoming better than yesterday — step by step

No shortcuts.  
No fake “expert” claims.  
Just real learning.
